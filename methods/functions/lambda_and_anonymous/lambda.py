"""
Python Lambda Functions are anonymous function means that the function is without a name. As we already know
that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define
an anonymous function in Python.

Syntax: lambda arguments: expression

This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.
You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
It has various uses in particular fields of programming, besides other types of expressions in functions.

# Example 1: Python Lambda Function with List Comprehension
is_even_list = [lambda arg=x: arg * 10 for x in range(1, 5)]

# iterate on each lambda function
# and invoke the function to get the calculated value
for item in is_even_list:
    print(item())

# Example of lambda function using if-else

maximum = lambda a, b: a if (a > b) else b

print(maximum(1, 2))

# Example 3: Python Lambda with Multiple statements
"""
Lambda functions does not allow multiple statements, however, we can create two lambda functions and then call the other
lambda function as a parameter to the first function. Letâ€™s try to find the second maximum element using lambda.

Using lambda() Function with filter()
"""

# Example 1: Filter out all odd numbers using filter() and lambda function

"""
Using lambda() Function with map()
The map() function in Python takes in a function and a list as an argument. The function is called 
with a lambda function and a list and a new list is returned which contains all the lambda modified items 
returned by that function for each item.

Using lambda() Function with reduce()
The reduce() function in Python takes in a function and a list as an argument. The function is called
